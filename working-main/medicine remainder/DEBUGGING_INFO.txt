DEBUGGING THE CONTINUOUS ALARM ISSUE:

To help diagnose the issue:

1. Open the medication reminder page in your browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Console
3. Go to the "Console" tab
4. Add a test medication with a time from a few minutes ago (e.g., if it's 2:35 PM, set time to 2:33 PM)
5. Click "Save All Medications"
6. Wait for the alarm to trigger (should happen within 5 seconds)
7. When alarm pops up, check the Console tab
8. Look for logs that say "[Reminder Check]" and "[markMedicationAsTaken]"
9. Send a screenshot of these logs

KEY LOGS TO LOOK FOR:
- "[Reminder Check] Dose: MedicationName at HH:MM, taken: false, notified: false" (before taking)
- "[Reminder TRIGGERED] MedicationName at HH:MM" (alarm shown)
- "[markMedicationAsTaken] Marked: MedicationName as taken and notified" (after clicking button)
- "[getSectionData] Preserved notified:true for MedicationName at HH:MM" (next save)

If the alarm keeps popping after clicking, check if the notified flag is being preserved.
